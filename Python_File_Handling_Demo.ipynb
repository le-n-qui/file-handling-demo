        "Above, we have effectively managed to make a file handler which we will use to write to our file. Although we could have provided a file name string as the first argument to our method open(), it is much cleaner and better for code maintainablity as we may want to change the name of our file in the future. You may notice the second argument and wonder what it means. So, we have different ways to indicate to our file handler what we want to do with our file. In summary, we can tell it to read our file's content ('**r**'), append to it ('**a**'), and write to it ('**w**'). There is also a choice for you to read and write with this '**r+**' option. One important note, with regards to our modes, is that the write mode is different from append mode in that it will overwrite whatever you may have had within your file. Be careful when you write to your file; know what is in your file and whether you want to start anew with it! With that said, let's write to our file!\n",
