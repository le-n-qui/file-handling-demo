Although we could have provided a file name string as the first argument to our method open(), it is much cleaner and better for code maintainablity as we may want to change the name of our file in the future. You may notice the second argument and wonder what it means. So, we have different ways to indicate to our file handler what we want to do with our file. In summary, we can tell it to read our file's content ('**r**'), append to it ('**a**'), and write to it ('**w**'). There is also a choice for you to read and write with this '**r+**' option. Explore other [modes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) on your free time! One important note, with regards to our modes, is that the write mode is different from append mode in that it will overwrite whatever you may have had within your file. Be careful when you write to your file; know what is in your file and whether you want to start anew with it! With that said, let's write to our file!\n",

        "These two methods are powerful because they give us the rein to freely move around our file and examine the data. Tell method, while in binary mode, returns an integer which is the number of bytes from the start of the file, and it indicates the file object's current position. Meanwhile, seeks allow us to determine what reference point we want to use to look at our file. We can seek from the beginning of the file, current file position, or the end of the file. All we need to do is to specify the _offset_ and _whence_ arguments of the seek method. We don't have to specify _whence_ if we are going to measure from the beginning of the file (_whence_ is 0 by default, with 1 being the current file position and 2 being the end of the file). It should be noted that the offset for referencing our file backwards is always a negative value, and we must open our file in binary mode if we want to use reference points from places other than the beginning of the file.

From the last three milestones, if you notice we repeatedly specify 1 when reading in one character or 2 when seeking from the end of file, you are not alone! Here is a piece of advice that has been passed down by many generations of great developers, and it is a good one: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). So, how do we apply this principle in our code? Since these literal values are the same in all three milestones, we can make constant variables storing them. "
